The goal of this project is to try and extract important geometric data from drumming and perhaps attempt to classify 
different drumbeats based on this data. The techniques I will be using to do this are likely to be pulled from various 
different areas but certainly I would like to start pf by analysing the topology of certain drumbeats and then look to some aspects of 
ML to attempt to solve a classification problem (perhaps a starting point would to classify by time signatures).
